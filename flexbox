# Everything you need to know about flexbox in simple words

display: flex; 
- Flexbox creates a container, the container has items
- Flex items occupy the size they are of the size (they don't grow or shrink automatically)

flex-grow: 1
- if each of the items has flex-grow: 1, each of the items will ocupy similar size to fill the whole flexbox container

- without grow, each flexbox item -> div will only ocopy the space it needs for its own content, here only for a number 1,2,3
```
<div class="flex border">
  <div class="border">1</div>
  <div class="border">2</div>
  <div class="border">3</div>
</div>
```
- with grow, each flexbox item will grow to a similar size to fill the whole flexbox container
```
<div class="flex border">
  <div class="border grow">1</div>
  <div class="border grow">2</div>
  <div class="border grow">3</div>
</div>
```

- adding grow-0, the flex item will not grow to fill the space inside the flexbox container, the div 1 and div 3 will grow to fill all the remaining space
```
<div class="flex border">
  <div class="border grow">1</div>
  <div class="border grow-0">2</div>
  <div class="border grow">3</div>
</div>
```
- flexbox is responsive and grows with the size of the screen and shrinks with the size of the screen

- flex basis sets the main initial size of the item
- there are other sizes such as basis-auto, sets the items size to the size it needs for the inner content
- basis-1/2 sets the item size to 50%, if the first div has basis-1/2 the other divs will split the rest 50% so each gets 25%.
```
<div class="flex border">
  <div class="border basis-4">1</div> <!-- basis-4 = 1rem = 16px -->
  <div class="border basis-24">2</div> <!-- basis-24 = 8rem = 128px -->
  <div class="border basis-64">3</div> <!-- basis-64 = 16rem = 256px -->
</div>
```
